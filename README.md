# Sentiment Analysis Classifier with ML.NET and User-Selectable Datasets
This repository contains a sentiment analysis classifier built using ML.NET. The application classifies movie reviews from the IMDB dataset into positive and negative sentiments.

## About
The project uses three different IMDB datasets which include text reviews and their corresponding sentiment labels (1 for positive and 0 for negative). The user can select which dataset to use at runtime. The model predicts whether a review is positive or negative based on the review's text. This type of problem is a typical binary classification task.

## Features
<h3>ML.NET</h3> The project uses ML.NET, a cross-platform, open source machine learning framework.
<h3>User-Selectable Datasets</h3> The user can select from three different IMDB datasets at runtime.
<h3>Binary Text Classification</h3> The project is an example of binary text classification, one of the most common applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP).
## How to Run
You can clone the repository and open the solution in your preferred C# IDE. Make sure you have the .NET Core SDK installed.

## Example output
The console application will prompt the user to select a dataset and enter a text for sentiment analysis. The application will then classify the sentiment of the text as positive or negative, and display the result in the console.
